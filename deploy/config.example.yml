# =============================================================================
#

#
# =============================================================================

# === REQUIRED - You must fill these in ===

# Your VPS IP address (from your hosting provider)
server_ip: ""

# Your domain name (must point to server_ip via DNS A record)
domain: ""

# Email for SSL certificate notifications (Let's Encrypt)
admin_email: ""

# REQUIRED: Strong password for PostgreSQL database
# This password is used to secure your database. Choose a strong, unique password.
# You'll need this password for:
#   - Database backups and restores
#   - Direct database access (psql, pgAdmin, etc.)
#   - External tools that connect to the database
#
# Example: postgres_password: "MySecureP@ssw0rd!2024"
postgres_password: ""  # REQUIRED - Set a strong password


# === OPTIONAL - Sensible defaults, change if needed ===

# SSH user for initial connection (usually root for fresh VPS)
ssh_user: root

# Application user (created on server, runs Docker containers)
app_user: stormcloud

# Internal port for Django (nginx proxies to this)
web_port: 8000

# Git branch to deploy
git_branch: main


# === FEATURES - Toggle what gets installed ===

install_docker: true
install_nginx: true
install_certbot: true
configure_firewall: true


# === CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ===
#
# OPTIONAL: Only needed if you have a web frontend on a different origin.
#
# CORS is NOT required for:
#   - API key authentication (curl, Postman, CLI tools)
#   - Server-to-server requests
#   - Mobile apps
#   - Same-origin requests (frontend and API on same domain)
#
# CORS IS required for:
#   - Web frontend (React, Vue, Angular) on different domain/port than API
#   - Browser-based requests from a different origin
#
# Example scenarios:
#   - Frontend at https://app.example.com, API at https://api.example.com
#   - Frontend at http://localhost:3000 (dev), API at https://cloud.example.com
#
# Format: Comma-separated list of full URLs (including protocol)
#   - Must include protocol: http:// or https://
#   - Must include port if non-standard: http://localhost:3000
#   - No trailing slashes
#
# Examples:
#   cors_origins: "https://app.example.com,https://dashboard.example.com"
#   cors_origins: "http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"
#   cors_origins: "https://app.example.com,http://localhost:3000"  # Mixed dev/prod
#
# Security notes:
#   - Only include origins you trust (your own frontend domains)
#   - Never use wildcards (*) in production
#   - Leave empty if you don't have a web frontend (most secure)
#
cors_origins: ""  # Optional - Only needed for web frontends on different origins
