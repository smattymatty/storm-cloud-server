# =============================================================================
# Storm Cloud Server - Deployment Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Copy this file to config.yml and edit with your values:
#   cp config.example.yml config.yml
#   micro config.yml
#
# Then deploy with:
#   make deploy
#
# =============================================================================

# === REQUIRED - You must fill these in ===

# Your VPS IP address (from your hosting provider)
server_ip: ""

# Your domain name (must point to server_ip via DNS A record)
domain: ""

# Email for SSL certificate notifications (Let's Encrypt)
admin_email: ""

# === OPTIONAL - Sensible defaults, change if needed ===

# SSH user for initial connection (usually root for fresh VPS)
ssh_user: root

# Application user (created on server, runs Docker containers)
app_user: stormcloud

# Internal port for Django (nginx proxies to this)
web_port: 8000

# Git branch to deploy
git_branch: main

# === FEATURES - Toggle what gets installed ===

install_docker: true
install_nginx: true
install_certbot: true
configure_firewall: true

# === SECRETS - Sensitive credentials ===
#
# IMPORTANT: Secrets are now managed via environment variables for better security.
# DO NOT store secrets in this config file.
#
# Set these environment variables before deploying:
#
#   export STORMCLOUD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
#   export STORMCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="your-django-secret-key"  # Optional (auto-generates if not set)
#   make deploy
#
# If environment variables are not set, you will be prompted during deployment.
#
# Generate a secure password:
#   openssl rand -base64 32
#
# Password manager integration:
#   export STORMCLOUD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(op read "op://vault/stormcloud/postgres_password")  # 1Password
#   export STORMCLOUD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(bw get password postgres_stormcloud)                # Bitwarden

# === CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ===
#
# CORS allows web browsers to make requests from your frontend application
# (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) running on a different origin to your API.
#
# Example scenarios:
#   - Frontend at https://app.example.com, API at https://api.example.com
#   - Frontend at http://localhost:3000 (dev), API at https://cloud.example.com
#
# Format: Comma-separated list of full URLs (including protocol)
#   - Must include protocol: http:// or https://
#   - Must include port if non-standard: http://localhost:3000
#   - No trailing slashes
#
# Examples:
#   cors_origins: "https://app.example.com,https://dashboard.example.com"
#   cors_origins: "http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"
#   cors_origins: "https://app.example.com,http://localhost:3000"  # Mixed dev/prod
#
# Security notes:
#   - Only include origins you trust (your own frontend domains)
#   - Never use wildcards (*) in production
#   - Leave empty to disable CORS (most secure, but frontend won't work)
#
cors_origins: "" # Comma-separated list, e.g., "https://app.example.com,https://dashboard.example.com"

# === FILE UPLOAD LIMITS - Storage configuration ===
#
# Maximum file size for uploads in megabytes (MB).
# This is a global limit applied to all uploads regardless of user quota.
#
# Default: 100 (100MB per file)
#
# Examples:
#   max_upload_size_mb: 50   # Limit to 50MB files
#   max_upload_size_mb: 500  # Allow up to 500MB files
#   max_upload_size_mb: 1024 # Allow up to 1GB files
#
# Notes:
#   - This is separate from per-user storage quotas (set via admin API)
#   - Very large files (>500MB) may cause memory issues on small VPS instances
#   - Per-user quotas managed via: PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/quota/
#   - See CLAUDE.md for quota management documentation
#
max_upload_size_mb: 100 # Maximum file size in MB

# === ADVANCED - Usually don't need to change ===

# Repository URL (change if you forked the project)
